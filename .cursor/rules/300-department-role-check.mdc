# Department Role Route Check Rule

## Context
When working with the FCU-AMS project, Department role routes need special handling to ensure proper access control and middleware checks.

## Rule Description
This rule enforces the following requirements when working with Department role routes:

1. Project Name Check:
   - Verify if the current project is "fcu-ams-new"
   - Only apply these checks if working in the correct project

2. Department Role Route Requirements:
   - Any new route created for Department users must be added to:
     - The `$allowedRoutesForDepartment` array in `app/Http/Middleware/CheckUserRole.php`

3. Route Naming Convention:
   - All Department routes should follow consistent naming patterns
   - Common prefixes: 'asset.', 'inventory.', 'profile.', etc.

## Implementation Guide

### Adding New Department Routes
When adding a new route for Department users:

1. First add the route to `CheckUserRole.php`:
```php
$allowedRoutesForDepartment = [
    // ... existing routes ...
    'new.route.name',
];
```

### Validation Steps
Before implementing any Department role functionality:

1. Verify project name is "fcu-ams-new"
2. Check existing allowed routes in CheckUserRole middleware
3. Test access with Department role credentials

## Examples

### ✅ Good Implementation
```php
// In routes/web.php
Route::get('/department/new-feature', [DepartmentController::class, 'newFeature'])
    ->name('department.new.feature')
    ->middleware('auth');

// In CheckUserRole.php
$allowedRoutesForDepartment = [
    // ... existing routes ...
    'department.new.feature',
];

// In sidebar-links.blade.php
@if(Auth::user()->role->role == 'Department')
    <a href="{{ route('department.new.feature') }}" class="...">
        New Feature
    </a>
@endif
```

### ❌ Bad Implementation
```php
// Missing from CheckUserRole.php
Route::get('/department/feature', [DepartmentController::class, 'feature'])
    ->name('department.feature');

// Only adding to sidebar without middleware check
@if(Auth::user()->role->role == 'Department')
    <a href="{{ route('department.feature') }}">Feature</a>
@endif
```

## Error Prevention
This rule helps prevent:
- Unauthorized access to Department routes
- Inconsistent route access control
- Missing sidebar links for new features
- Improper middleware implementation

## Compliance Check
When reviewing code changes:
1. Is the project "fcu-ams-new"?
2. Are new Department routes added to CheckUserRole middleware?
3. Are sidebar links properly implemented?
4. Is the route naming consistent with existing patterns?
