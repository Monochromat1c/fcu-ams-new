# Targeted UI Modification Rule

## Context
When making UI changes to specific sections or components within a larger layout:
- Only modify the exact section requested
- Preserve surrounding layout and structure
- Maintain existing styling patterns

## Requirements

1. Scope Identification:
   - Clearly identify the specific section to modify
   - Document the parent and sibling elements that must remain unchanged
   - Note any existing styling patterns that should be maintained

2. Change Isolation:
   - Only modify the target section's HTML/CSS
   - Preserve all parent container structures
   - Maintain existing grid layouts and spacing
   - Keep existing responsive behavior

3. Style Consistency:
   - Use existing color schemes
   - Match typography patterns
   - Maintain spacing conventions
   - Follow existing component patterns

4. Layout Preservation:
   - Keep parent grid/flex structures
   - Maintain existing margins and padding
   - Preserve responsive breakpoints
   - Keep existing alignment patterns

## Examples

<example>
<!-- Good: Targeted modification of just the notes section -->
<div class="existing-parent">
    <!-- ... existing code ... -->
    <div class="modified-section">
        <!-- Only this section is changed -->
        <span class="font-medium">Notes:</span>
        <p class="text-gray-600">{{ $notes }}</p>
    </div>
    <!-- ... existing code ... -->
</div>
</example>

<example type="invalid">
<!-- Bad: Modifying parent structures -->
<div class="new-parent-structure">
    <!-- Changed too much, affecting layout -->
    <div class="new-grid">
        <!-- Completely new structure -->
    </div>
</div>
</example>
