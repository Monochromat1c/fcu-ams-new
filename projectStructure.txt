1. Core Project Structure:

- 1 feature module: Dashboard

2. Key Models:
- Asset: Core model for tracking physical assets

3. Module Relationships:
- UserManagement controls access to other modules
- AlertSystem monitors assets, inventory, and leases
- Dashboard displays asset and inventory information
- LeaseManagement uses assets for leasing

4. Model Relationships:
- Assets belong to departments, categories, and brands
- Assets are supplied by suppliers
- Assets are located at locations
- Assets have conditions and statuses
- Inventory items belong to categories and brands
- Inventory items are supplied by suppliers

5. Access Control:

The system appears to be a comprehensive asset management solution with:
- Asset tracking and management
- Inventory control
- Lease management
- Supply request handling
- Maintenance tracking
- QR code integration
- Reporting capabilities
- Role-based access control

Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of the system in more detail?
